# Introduction to machine learning with scikit-learn


Here are the topics I covered:

1. Model building in scikit-learn (refresher)
2. Representing text as numerical data
3. Reading a text-based dataset into pandas
4. Vectorizing our dataset
5. Building and evaluating a model
6. Comparing models
7. Examining a model for further insight
8. Practicing this workflow on another dataset
9. Tuning the vectorizer (discussion)
